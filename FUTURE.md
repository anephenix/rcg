#### CLI

After you have installed rcg, you can call its command-line with npx

```
npx rcg --init
```

This command will do the following:

- Ask you which folder you want generated React components to be put in
- Ask you what style you want React components to use (class, pure function)
- Ask you what style library you want to use (sass, styled-components, css-in-js)
- Ask you what testing library you want to use (jest, mocha, ava, enzyme, react-testing-library)
